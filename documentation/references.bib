It is the spirit and inspiration that leads associates to apply their human capital to meet the goalsof the organization, the human spirit is highly inspired through motivation. Motivationis essential to almost any aspect of life. Understanding job satisfaction and work motivation can be key elements to improving productivity. This paper seeks to introduce the four major need theories areas: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Herzberg's Motivation Theory, Alderfer's ERG Theory, and McClelland's Need for Achievement Theory. It also goes further to analyze these theories bringing to the fore various similarities and differences that exist amongst them.},

It does include propositions relating the impact of higher-order frustration to the strength of lower-order needs. Empirical tests of differential predictions among Maslow's theory, the simple frustration hypothesis, and E.R.G. theory were conducted by a questionnaire study with 110 employees at several job levels from a bank. The results tended to support E.R.G. theory more than Maslow's theory or the simple frustration hypothesis.},

First, using input from commercial pilots who had a minimum of total 5,000 flying hour and currently working for either premium or low cost airlines in Thailand. Second, translated quality of work life items from a published research on Quality of Work Life of Personnel at Dhurakij Pundit University by Chatthai (2016). After the content analysis, the left items for the EFA analysis were 30 items. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) demonstrated at 0.93. The exploratory factor analysis was to examine the loading patterns of QWL items. A principal component and orthogonal rotation (Verimax method) were chosen. It showed there were five structural factor patterns. The five factors were labored as ``Human Resource Management''; ``Social Relation''; ``Safe Working Environment''; ``Work-Life Balance''; and ``Fairness and Respect''. Discussion and future research are also discussed.},

The biological and psychosocial risks facing pilots, including fatigue, disrupted circadian rhythms, and stress, directly impact flight safety and have gained attention. Yet, exploring these psychosocial risks from an Industrial/Organizational Psychology perspective remains a relatively new approach. The current study seeks to advance the field by examining the mechanisms underpinning job satisfaction among commercial airline pilots, specifically focusing on the impact of psychosocial risk factors inherent in their profession. To achieve this goal, the study tested the relationship between psychological capital, mindfulness, work-life balance, and job satisfaction. This exploratory research aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of job satisfaction among pilots employed by commercial airlines in Turkey, with data collected from 94 commercial airline pilots. Results revealed a positive relationship between psychological capital, mindfulness, work-life balance, and job satisfaction. Additionally, the findings indicated that work-life balance mediates both mindfulness-job satisfaction and psychological capital-job satisfaction relationships. According to the study findings, work-life balance has a significant role in mediating the personal strengths and pilots' satisfaction level with their jobs. The direct and indirect impacts of mindfulness, psychological capital, and work-life balance on job satisfaction suggest that enhanced work-life balance and strengthened personal resources positively influence job satisfaction, within the context of psychosocial risk factors faced by commercial airline pilots.},

The leavers~(those who left the company) in this sample were compared with the stayers (those who~remained in the employ of the company) in this sample in respect of different variables used~in the study.Main findings: It was established that the TIS-6 could measure turnover intentions reliably~({$\alpha$}= 0.80). The TIS-6 could significantly distinguish between leavers and stayers (actual~turnover), thereby confirming its criterion-predictive validity. The scale also established~statistically significant differences between leavers and stayers in respect of a number of the~remaining theoretical variables used in the study, thereby also confirming its differential~validity. These comparisons were conducted for both the 4-month and the 4-year period after~the survey was conducted.Practical/managerial implications: Turnover intention is related to a number of variables~in the study which necessitates a reappraisal and a reconceptualisation of existing turnover~intention models.Contribution/value-add: The TIS-6 can be used as a reliable and valid scale to assess turnover~intentions and can therefore be used in research to validly and reliably assess turnover~intentions or to predict actual turnover.},

In this article, we argue that the entrenchment and increased investment associated with job embeddedness run parallel to the concept of role involvement from the work--family conflict literature. Drawing on this similarity, we extend theory and research regarding work--family conflict to develop and test predictions about the moderating role of off-the-job embeddedness on the effects of on-the-job embeddedness on involuntary turnover. Specifically, we predicted that being highly embedded on-the-job can reduce the likelihood of being fired because it increases job performance, but that these benefits are only accrued when employees are not also highly embedded off-the-job. We tested our predictions using a sample of 908 government employees from whom we collected performance and turnover data over time. Consistent with our predictions, among employees who were highly embedded on-the-job, those who were less embedded off-the-job were less likely to be terminated than those who were more embedded off-the-job. However, job performance did not explain this effect. In addition to providing a rare examination of involuntary turnover, we contribute to the job embeddedness literature by demonstrating the importance of distinguishing between, and simultaneously examining, on- and off-the-job embeddedness and their unique, multiplicative effects. We also demonstrate the utility of the WFC literature in advancing theory and research on job embeddedness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between sources of work-related stress (WRS) for pilots, effects on wellbeing, and coping mechanisms. Background: Recent studies have measured depression levels in pilots but not the relationship between depression levels and coping strategies. Methods: An anonymous web-based survey was conducted with commercial pilots. A regression model was advanced to analyze the relationship between each frequency level of each coping strategy and PHQ-9 Scores, and the Odds ratio was interpreted. Results: Sources of WRS impact on the physical, social, and psychological health of pilots. Not all pilots are suffering. Over half met threshold for mild depression. Nearly 60\% are using coping mechanisms to manage WRS and its impact on wellbeing. Pilots using coping mechanisms such as sleep management, taking physical exercise, and diet management were found to have lower depression severity levels. The findings of this study underscore the need to advance new tools to enable pilot self-management of their health and wellbeing. This includes new training tools, enhanced checklists, and new digital tools to support wellbeing awareness, stress coping, and risk identification both inside and outside the cockpit. Conclusions: Airlines and pilots need the right tools to safeguard the wellbeing and mental fitness of pilots and ensure flight safety. Pilots, airlines, and aviation regulators can learn from the existing use of coping strategies by pilots.},

These solutions include dramatic pay raises and cadet programs. One of the most significant causes of the pilot shortage is the aviation industry's rapid growth. Other factors include the aging pilot population and high flight training costs. In addition, regional airlines, a major source of pilots for major airlines, have a historically low pay rate, which deters pilots from wanting to work for them. This situation is compounded by a lack of hiring in the 2000s for various reasons. The effects of the pilot shortage include decreased flights, loss of revenue, and closing of some regional airlines. Airlines have implemented various solutions aimed at increasing the number of pilots. These include an increased pay rate, job pathway programs through universities, and guaranteed interviews or jobs. The solutions proposed will likely prove their effectiveness in minimizing the pilot shortage over the next decade.},

  abstract = {This article contributes to `sociology of professions' theory through the study of changes that occurred in US airline pilots' work. Findings reveal that airline pilots are quasi-professional experts who developed specialized skills based on talent and experience which allowed them to work autonomously and enjoy a correspondingly high sense of trust and prestige for which they were often well compensated. However, results of this study suggest high labour costs and weak professional communities leave quasi-professional experts vulnerable to managerial cost-cutting and work intensification agendas, particularly during periods of merger, downsizing and other forms of industry restructuring. Findings signal a deprofessionalization of some elite fields in which experts' specialized skills become devalued and the industry-specific nature of their expertise reduces career options and job mobility. Although the present study identifies this trend in aviation, recent changes in a wide range of industries from healthcare to high-tech portend applicability in a variety of domains.},

Using data drawn from three different sources (subordinates, supervisors, and company records), results from a sample of healthcare employees ( n = 205) provide support for the core relationships proposed in the group engagement model and extend the model by showing that prestige and respect have different antecedents. The perceived status of the organization's employees, the organization's perceived success in achieving its goals, the visibility of the organization, and the status level of the individual employee were all associated with perceived external prestige. The results also indicate that visibility within the organization, perceived opportunities for growth, and participation in decision-making were all related to perceived respect. Further, prestige and respect were directly related to organizational identification, but only indirectly related to organization-supportive behavior. These results extend the group engagement model in that we utilize a form of supportive behavior that focuses upon constructive change (i.e. voice behavior; Van Dyne \& LePine, 1998), rather than the helpful, but status quo maintaining behavior.},

To meet the challenge of these low cost airlines, several `legacy' or full service carriers (FSCs) around the world have created their own low cost subsidiary. The most notable example in the UK was Go, initially a low cost subsidiary of British Airways (BA) that was subsequently sold to its senior management team and then bought by easyJet, the UK's leading low cost airline. For low cost subsidiaries to survive and prosper, `matching' models of human resource management (HRM) predict that they need to create a low cost employment system, which will be very different from that of the parent company. However, cost is only one variable in the competitive equation. In a `customer facing' industry such as civil aviation a minimum level of service quality is also required and there is clearly scope for `low frills' (e.g. Southwest Airlines) as opposed to `no frills' (e.g. Ryanair).

Both the qualitative and quantitative results suggest that relational factors-conflict and workplace culture-are more important determinants of performance than the structural factors of unionization, shared governance, and wages. The authors conclude that efforts to recover from the current crisis in the airline industry that depend primarily on reductions in wages or union power will at best bring only short-term relief from immediate financial pressures. Sustained improvement in service quality and financial performance will require more fundamental improvements in the quality of labor relations.},

Certain airlines emerged successful and demonstrated remarkable resilience while others languished. This investigation identifies reasons why some airline companies recovered successfully after the attacks while others struggled. Evidence is provided that layoffs after the crisis, although intended to foster recovery, instead inhibited recovery throughout the 4 years after the crisis. But, layoffs after the crisis were strongly correlated with lack of financial reserves and lack of a viable business model prior to the crisis. Digging deeper, the authors find that having a viable business model itself depended on the development and preservation of relational reserves over time. Our model shows that the maintenance of adequate financial reserves enables the preservation of relational reserves and vice versa, contributing to organizational resilience in times of crisis.},

  abstract = {Quality work that fosters job satisfaction and health enjoys top priority in industry all over the world. This was not always so. Until recently analysis of job attitudes focused primarily on human relations problems within organizations. While American industry was trying to solve the unsolvable problem of avoiding interpersonal dissatisfaction, problems with the potential for solution, such as training and quality production, were ignored. When first published, The Motivation to Work challenged the received wisdom by showing that worker fulfillment came from achievement and growth within the job itself. In his new introduction, Herzberg examines thirty years of motivational research in job-related areas. Based on workers' accounts of real events that have made them feel good or bad on the job, the findings of Herzberg and his colleagues have stimulated research and controversy that continue to the present day. The authors surprisingly found that while a poor work environment generated discontent, improved conditions seldom brought about improved attitudes. Instead, satisfaction came most often from factors intrinsic to work: achievements, job recognition, and work that was challenging, interesting, and responsible. The evidence marshaled by this volume called into question many previous assumptions about job satisfaction and worker motivation. Feelings about intrinsic and extrinsic factors could not be validly averaged on a single scale of measurement. Motivation and performance are not merely dependent upon environmental needs and external rewards. Frederick Herzberg and his staff based their motivation---hygiene theory on a variety of human needs and applied it to a strategy of job enrichment that has widely influenced motivation and job design strategies. Motivation to Work is a landmark volume that is of enduring interest to sociologists, psychologists, labor studies specialists, and organization analysts.},

We next review the more contemporary unfolding model and its derivatives (i.e., shocks research, leader-departure effect, turnover event theory) that upended traditional explanations of how and why employees quit. After reviewing classic and contemporary turnover models, we shift our focus to job embeddedness, which over the past 20-plus years has taught us a great deal about why employees stay. We synthesize original job embeddedness research before appraising its extensions and recent developments. We conclude with a discussion of how organizations can cultivate the ``right'' kind of staying.},

A literature review identifies shortcomings with prevailing turnover dimensions. In response, we expand the conceptual domain of the turnover criterion to include multiple types of turnover (notably, involuntary quits) and multiple types of staying. Guided by the premise that ``everyone eventually leaves; no one stays with an organization forever,'' we also suggest considering where leavers end up---or post-exit destinations, such as another job, full-time parenting, or educational pursuits. We propose ``proximal withdrawal states'' that motivate members to participate or withdraw from organizations as an expanded criterion. These motivational states precede turnover and are derived from 2 overarching dimensions: desired employment status (whether employees want to stay or leave) and perceived volitional control (whether quit or stay decisions are completely up to them or at least partially under external regulation). Crossing these dimensions yields 4 prime states: enthusiastic leavers and stayers and reluctant leavers and stayers. We further subdivide these mind-sets into subtypes by differentiating employer from other forms of external control (e.g., family). Focusing on more common subtypes, we explain how they arise from particular motivational forces and profile how they differ by attitudes, behaviors, and turnover speed and destinations. We further discuss ways to measure this expanded criterion and proximal states (and subtypes) and investigate the latter's profiled differences.

  abstract = {The importance of job satisfaction to human beings is a widely studied phenomenon, due to the assumption that job satisfaction is a major contributor to the well-being of employees and to       several organisational outcomes. Most of these studies have focused on the influence of organisational variables on job satisfaction. Few studies have investigated the relationship between       pilot-related factors and the job satisfaction levels of aviators. In a study of 704 South African pilots, significant differences were found in job satisfaction levels with regard to the       nature of a pilot's flying duty, area(s) of operation, type(s) of licence and level of command.                 Werkstevredenheid en die belangrikheid daarvan vir die mens is 'n onderwerp waaroor navorsing dikwels gedoen word. Die rede hiervoor is die aanname dat werkstevredenheid 'n belangrike bydraende       faktor is tot werknemerswelsyn en verskeie organisatoriese uitkomste. Die meeste van hierdie studies het gekonsentreer op die invloed van organisatoriese veranderlikes op werkstevredenheid. Min       navorsing is egter gedoen oor die verband tussen vliegverwante veranderlikes en die vlakke van werkstevredenheid van vlie\"eniers. In 'n studie van 704 Suid-Afrikaanse vlie\"eniers is beduidende       verskille gevind tussen die werkstevredenheidsvlakke van vlie\"eniers met betrekking tot die aard van vlie\"eniers se vliegtaak, area(s) van werksaamheid, soort(e) lisensie(s) en vlak van       bevelvoering.},

While some of the expectations are confirmed, unionisation is higher than anticipated in the LCC sector and a relatively high percentage of staff were on regular rather than contingent contracts. Differences in approach are observed among LCC airlines, and the evidence indicates some convergence between the two sectors as competition heightens.},

  abstract = {Background: Interest in post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome following COVID-19 infection has been increasing. Maintaining quality of life (QoL) is vital for airline crews because they work in a special environment, where they are responsible for the passengers' safety. This study aims to closely investigate factors affecting the QoL of airline crews, including post-COVID-19 syndrome. Methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey, comprising 167 crews. Findings: Age-specific significant differences were observed in social, overall, and total QoL scores. The physical domain QoL was significantly higher in the cockpit crews than that in the cabin crews. Significant differences were found in psychological and overall QoL depending on years of continuous service. Social domain and environmental QoL were lower in those who had no symptoms after being diagnosed with COVID-19 than in those who were symptomatic. Among the participants, 4.2\% had post-COVID-19 syndrome, indicating significant differences in the physical domain, depending on whether they exhibit post-COVID-19 syndrome. Conclusion: It is urgent to develop measures to increase the QoL of airline crews, investigate post-COVID-19 syndrome before returning to work, and develop strategies to manage it. Application to practice: The QoL among airline crews differed not only by the demographic characteristics of the participants but also by the presence of symptoms during COVID-19 diagnosis and post-COVID-19 syndrome. Higher QoL among airline crews is associated with the safety of both airline crews and passengers. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a systematic management protocol for airline crews returning to work after following COVID-19 infection.},

The aviation industry has undergone a series of devastating changes since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, the implications of the pandemic on pilots' JS are unknown. Quantitative JS measurements were taken from 203 European and Middle Eastern pilots, during the pandemic (March, 2021), using the shortened Job Descriptive Index and Job In General validated scales. Follow-up semi-structured interviews (April 2021) were conducted with 16 participants to establish pre-pandemic JS levels and identify the degree of change due to COVID-19. Significant JS differences (p {$<~$}.001) were observed between military and airline pilots; the former having higher levels. Qualitative findings revealed that airline pilots' levels decreased due to factors such as job security, pay cuts, opportunities for promotion and skill-fade concerns. Military pilots experienced an increased JS, as state-funded organizations were not substantially affected by COVID-19, which led to a feeling of appreciation and thankfulness. COVID-19 has caused a major disruption to JS of military and airline pilots. Suggested mitigation measures for the civil aviation sector comprised effective communication between pilots and managers to reduce the pandemic-induced job uncertainty. Solutions such as extra flight simulator sorties were recommended to tackle the skill-fade effect.},

A review of the literature reveals a significant gap to be filled regarding the structure of airline pilot's pay and the way in which it has changed due to the pandemic. To explore this subject further in the context of the crisis, a conceptual framework is developed and an empirical study in the context of Australia is conducted. It is found that within Australia there has been a shift towards more productivity-based pilot remuneration strategies recently, with Virgin Australia opting for significant structural changes in how pilots are paid. A move to more productivitybased pay need not necessarily penalise pilots in the long-term but can provide significant savings in the short-term. For countries with highly unionised pilot workforces such as Australia, it is recommended that a pay structure to cater for a drop in demand is considered even during negotiations in good times.},

Prior to the rule change, pilots were willing to fly for regional airlines at low pay as a stepping-stone to a career at major airlines. Since the rule change, higher minimum qualifications requiring a greater investment for aspiring pilots appear to have impacted the appeal of this career path. This study explores that claim with the purpose of understanding the impact of the FOQ rule change on the career aspirations of collegiate aviation flight students and examining student perceptions of the regional airline career path. To address these issues, a survey of collegiate aviation flight students was conducted. The results showed that the FOQ rule change has negatively impacted the airline pilot career plans of a portion of collegiate aviation students. The primary concerns voiced were the increased time and investment needed to meet the new requirements and the negative perceptions of the regional airline career path. Regarding perceptions of the regional airline path, pay was consistently the top concern of aspiring pilots, followed by quality of life factors and the desire for a clear path to the major airlines. In addition, large numbers of aspiring pilots indicated that they are willing to fly overseas for better career opportunities. These results provide new insight into multiple factors influencing the collegiate pilot pipeline.},

A statistic \$U\$ depending on the relative ranks of the \$x\$'s and \$y\$'s is proposed for testing the hypothesis \$f = g\$. Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis \$f = g\$ the probability of obtaining a given \$U\$ in a sample of \$n x's\$ and \$m y's\$ is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving \$n\$ and \$m\$. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of \$U\$ for samples up to \$n = m = 8\$. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if \$m, n\$ go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives \$f(x) {$>$} g(x)\$ for every \$x\$.},

The corollary is that precarious professional employment is an emerging, pervasive type of low-cost employment system in the studied context. In terms of theoretical implications, our study highlights the need for exactness in understanding the complexities of declining professional standing and increasingly precarious employment. Our analysis offers an exact term, pilot-cariat, to encapsulate contemporary, UK-based and experienced commercial airline pilot employment.

  abstract = {COVID-19 has led to thousands of pilots being grounded, significantly impacting airline training and safety during operational recovery. Previous research has suggested that the airline safety climate has been negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly because of borders closure and a sudden loss of revenue. This context led to thousands of pilots being furloughed or dismissed, increasing their stress and anxiety due to financial hardship and resource constraints. However, the influence of the pandemic on how pilots maintained their proficiency while stood down and how they kept engaged with the airline, and therefore the safety climate, has not yet been researched. Hence, this study sought to evaluate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on grounded pilots. We evaluated the operational distractions caused by the pandemic, external stressors influencing motivation and morale towards work, and how this affected safety climate. A questionnaire study was conducted with 105 airline pilots who were grounded for longer than three months, requiring refresher training and then returned to operational flying. The research found that approximately half of the participants did not engage in any skill and knowledge upkeeping whilst grounded. COVID-19 measures restricted the access to training facilities for many participants, negatively influencing their motivation to skill-upkeeping. Uncertainty with sudden and indefinite grounding periods made it challenging to maintain engagement and motivation. Job-reattachment was further aggravated by the additional financial and personal stress. The pandemic led to distractions in effectively applying their skills to the job. Physical and mental health concerns were mentioned by many participants as a factor influencing their job performance. The study proposes recommendations for airlines to improve engagement of grounded pilots and pilots in isolation.},

Results suggest that increases in perceptions of organizational and community embeddedness are associated with increases in work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict over time. Further, we found that these effects were even stronger for employees with highly individualistic values. Thus, although much of the previous research has focused on the positive effects of employee embeddedness for individuals' work lives, the present study provides some evidence of the potentially negative effects of employee embeddedness for individuals' family lives.

Because older workers are also more likely to have longer organizational tenure, negative age stereotypes contribute to the perception that long-tenured workers are less innovative and more resistant to change, too. Guided by human capital theory, this study argues that the capacity to contribute to innovation-related behaviours (IRB) might actually grow with age and tenure, counteracting the presumed age-related declines in this type of job performance. Using a meta-analysis that included 98 empirical studies, the present research examines the relationships of age and organizational tenure with the generation, dissemination, and implementation of new ideas. Overall, the pattern of results in the study suggests that older workers and longer-tenured workers do not engage in less innovation-related behaviour than their younger and more junior counterparts. In addition, there is little evidence of curvilinearity in the relationships of age and tenure with IRB; workers at the high end of the age and tenure distributions did not perform especially poorly on these tasks. Practitioner points: 1. Contrary to common belief, the results of this study show that age and tenure are not negatively related to innovation-related behaviours. 2. That is, older and longer-tenured workers do not engage in less innovation-related behaviour than younger, more junior workers. 3. These results hold true even at the high end of the age and years-of-service continuum. 3. This study concludes that the negative stereotype that older and longer-tenured workers are less innovative is not based on accumulated empirical evidence. 4. As such, excluding older workers from innovation-related tasks is counterproductive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {This study explores the emerging trends in employee retention strategies in a globalizing economy, with a focus on Nigeria. The paper argues that globalization has enhanced the mobility of labor, and has also accelerated the rate of employee turnover in organizations in Nigeria. The paper identifies some of the reasons for turnover to include inequity in the compensation packages of organizations, employees' dissatisfaction and autocratic managerial pattern in most organizations in Nigeria. It further identifies the effects of turnover to include disruption in production, cost of training new employees, the recruitment and selection cost and knowledge lost. As a panacea to minimize the rate of employee turnover and catch up with the current demands of global economic needs and organizational performance, the study proposes that organizations in Nigeria should adopt critical sustainable retention trends such as establishing a strategic plan, involving employees in decision-making process, initiating personalized compensation plan, installing mechanisms for career planning, training and development and building flexible work programs especially for critical knowledge - employees. These will help to retain core employees that will competitively drive the production wheel in the organizations in Nigeria in this era of globalization.},

The four factors were working conditions and school climate; administrative support and leadership practices; teacher self-efficacy; and the COVID-19 pandemic. The researcher developed two questionnaires (i.e., Teacher Retention Questionnaire for Teachers and Teacher Retention Questionnaire for Administrators) to gather the data for the study. A total of 324 teachers (30.39\% return rate) and 26 administrators (50\% return rate) from an urban Midwest P-12+ public school district participated in this study and anonymity was assured. Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory and Self-Efficacy Theory were used to frame this study. Findings indicated working conditions and school climate, along with administrative support and leadership practices were shown as most correlated to teacher retention. No correlation with retention was obtained when teacher self-efficacy or COVID-19 pandemic issues were explored. Recommendations for school administrators resulting from this study relate to enhancing school climate to increase job satisfaction and implementing leadership practices that value a personal connection (i.e., trust, respect) with teachers. School leaders should assist teachers with increasing parent involvement, addressing disruptive behaviors, and aiding students with low academic interest to boost the school climate. Recommendations for future research focuses on understanding self-efficacy results (i.e., not correlated to retention) and to continue exploring other factors that prevent teacher retention phenomenon.},

Study 1 demonstrates that job search mediates the positive relationship between job insecurity and voluntary turnover, and that employees higher in on-the-job embeddedness are less likely to search for jobs despite job insecurity. Study 2 demonstrates that turnover intention mediates the positive relationship between job insecurity and voluntary turnover, and that employees higher in on-the-job embeddedness are less likely to contemplate quitting despite job insecurity. However, off-the-job embeddedness had opposite interactive effects, exacerbating the relationship of job insecurity with turnover.},

Managing retention and keeping the turnover rate below target and industry norms is one of the most challenging issues facing business. All indications point toward the issue compounding in the future and, even as economic times change, turnover will continue to be an important issue for most job groups. Yet despite these facts employee turnover continues to be the most unappreciated and undervalued issue facing business leaders. There are a variety of reasons for this, for example, the true cost of employee turnover is often underestimated. The causes of turnover are not adequately identified, and solutions are often not matched with the causes, so they fail. Preventive measures are either not in place or do not target the issues properly, and therefore have little or no effect, and a method for measuring progress and identifying a monetary value (ROI) on retention does not exist in most organizations.'Managing Employee Retention' is a practical guide for managers to retain their talented employees. It shows how to manage and monitor turnover and how to develop the ROI of keeping your talent using innovative retention programs. The book presents a logical process of managing retention, from identifying turnover costs and causes, designing solutions that match the causes of turnover, developing tools for tracking turnover and placing alerts when action is needed, and measuring the ROI of retention programs.},

In this study, we propose that on-the-job and off-the-job embeddedness play distinct roles in strengthening or weakening the positive relationship between informal job search and turnover intentions and behavior. We assert that on-the-job embeddedness reduces the likelihood that informal job search translates into turnover decisions, whereas off-the-job embeddedness strengthens the positive association between informal job search and turnover decisions. We tested these hypotheses across two samples of employed nurses. Although results were mixed, we found evidence that on-the-job embeddedness dampened the positive relationships of informal job search with turnover intentions and behaviors, whereas off-the-job embeddedness facilitated the positive relationships between informal job search and turnover decisions. Taken together, findings suggest that on-the-job and off-the-job embeddedness influence informal job search processes differently. We discuss the implications of these findings for how organizations manage employees' informal job search activities as well as how researchers approach the study of job embeddedness.

Using cross-cultural data from call centers (N   797), we demonstrated that although organization job embeddedness predicted turnover in both countries, different dimensions of job embeddedness predicted turnover in the United States and India. As hypothesized, on the basis of individualism-- collectivism theory, person--job fit was a significant predictor of lower turnover in the United States, whereas person-- organization fit, organization links, and community links were significant predictors of lower turnover in India. We also explored whether a newly developed construct of embeddedness---family embeddedness---predicts turnover above and beyond job embeddedness and found initial support for its utility in both the United States and India. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

How well a less experienced crew identifies and mitigates threats posed by the humanmachine interface is a measure of their overall performance. In addition, pilot performance relative to interaction with glass cockpit technology is influenced by overall Team Situation Awareness. Humans and machines do not always interact at an optimal level, and this report reviews literature to understand how Mutual Performance Monitoring, Crew Resource Management (CRM), and the formation of Shared Mental Models affect Team Situation Awareness and performance in a regional airline flight deck.},

Intrinsic motivation remains an important construct, reflecting the natural human propensity to learn and assimilate. However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes of motives to basic human needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are discussed.},

Retail business leaders who fail to address voluntary turnover intention face increased voluntary employee turnover and reduced operational performance. Grounded in equity theory, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between employee job performance, employee compensation, and voluntary turnover intention in the retail industry. Data were collected from 76 Texas retail store management employees using the Self-Rated Job Performance Survey, Compensation Survey, and Modified Turnover Intention Scale. The results of the multiple linear regression were significant, F (2, 73) = 4.43, p = .01, R2 = .11, indicating that job performance and compensation explained 11\% of the variance in turnover intention. Only job performance ({$\beta$} = .26, t = 2.39, p = .02) made a unique contribution to the model. A key recommendation is for business leaders to focus on retaining highly productive employees using nonmonetary incentives, including more paid time off, greater scheduling flexibility, and better healthcare options. The implications for positive social change include the potential to decrease unemployment and increase tax revenues, which may contribute to higher household incomes, standards of living, and tax revenues for social programs, benefiting residents in local communities.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to find out the effect of recruitment practices on the retention of commercial pilots by the airlines in India. Often it is found that trained pilots pilfered by other airlines within/outside of India and Indian aviation industry have to rely on expatriate pilots to fly the aircrafts. Newly appointed pilots are required to be trained due to the lack of experience, which is a huge investment by the airlines. Therefore, the recruitment and retention of the commercial pilots create challenges for aviation industry in India. Design/methodology/approach Research design of the present study was exploratory and descriptive to evaluate the effect of recruitment practices on the retention of commercial pilots by airlines in India. All together, 225 commercial pilots from different Indian airlines participated in the present study. Instruments were designed to understand the practices related to recruitment, selection and retention strategies of commercial pilots used by these airlines, and how pilots perceive about recruitment practices and its relevance for retention strategies in the organization. Data were analyzed using factor analysis, Pearson's correlation and regression analysis Findings Results of data analysis have revealed five factors of retention and selection measures, which were encouraging and employee-friendly recruitment policy, impact of external factors, organizational internal factors, employment brand and organizational growth and self-advancement opportunities. Similarly, retention strategies measures had four factors, namely, positive work culture, opportunities for individual growth, development, and salary benefit package, and opportunity for self-achievement. Pearson product moment correlation coefficient result revealed significantly positive relationship between various dimensions of recruitment and selection to retention strategies. Further regression analysis revealed the effect of those recruitment policies on retention was positive. Research limitations/implications Findings of this study could be potential bias and prejudice of the people involved and responded. As information was collected only form Indian commercial pilots, the findings might have changed if study was to be applied to a different country or economy. Random sampling error could not be ruled out. Preferred, accepted and perceived recruitment strategies and retention polices of Indian aviation sectors might be different as compare to other countries aviation sectors policies. Influence of cultural, organizational internal and external factors result might be different as compared to result of present study. Practical implications This is an important study, which will help the aviation sector to design recruitment policies and retention strategies to retain pilots to deal with a high level of attrition. Furthermore, present study will help the aviation sector in designing their policies and strategies, which forces pilots to remain with particular air carrier for longer time. It will give the same direction to other organizations, in general. Social implications The concept of recruitment and retention is applicable to each and every service sector. There could be different parameters for the same. Social implication of the present study is the same as it is for the aviation sectors. It is implied that service sectors must have appropriate recruitment policies, i.e. encouraging and employee friendly recruitment policy, conscious and continuous evaluation organizations' external as well as internal factor, efforts shall be made to create employment branding, always focus on growth and advancement opportunities for the employees and organization. Positive work culture, opportunities for individual growth and development, salary benefit package and opportunity for self-achievement will help employees to remain with the organization for longer time. Originality/value This is an original research in the area of understanding recruitment policies and retention practices of commercial pilots in Indian aviation industry. This study is related to practical and genuine problem of attrition. Not many studies are found in this particular area.},

The airline industry has faced many threats throughout history, but none quite as rapid and severe as the one posed by the spread of COVID-19. One constant during uncertainty shocks and industry downturns is that airline labor bears the brunt of the decline. As the industry reduces capacity amid the increase in travel restrictions, the post-stimulus impacts to airline labor are not known. Using time series analysis, the dynamics of historical uncertainty shocks to the industry are examined. During periods of uncertainty shocks, the estimated job loss is nearly 7\% of the airline workforce with an upper bound of over 13\%. Major airline employment is most impacted, while low-cost and regional airline employment is least impacted. The hardest hit employees are ones related to passenger handling and flight operations, while management employees fair slightly better during these uncertain periods. Further, recovery following uncertainty shocks is estimated to take between 4 and 6\,years. Overall, the labor impacts to the airline industry from uncertainty events are substantial and provide insight into the expected industry job loss from COVID-19.},

Theresearch involved 373 Generation Z respondents across various industries, employing a quantitative approach.Data collection was facilitated through online questionnaires, and analysis was conducted using StructuralEquation Modeling (SEM) with Partial Least Square (PLS) as the analytical tool. The findings reveal significantrelationships between various constructs. Work-life balance influences employee retention, turnover intention,and job embeddedness. Additionally, job embeddedness exerts an impact on both employee retention and turnoverintention. Furthermore, work-life balance indirectly affects employee retention and turnover intention throughits mediation by job embeddedness. The inclusion of diverse industries ensures that the results are broadlyapplicable, offering practical recommendations for fostering a resilient and engaged workforce in differentprofessional environments.

This research aims to examine the impact of COVID-19 on commercial airline pilots' job satisfaction before and during the pandemic and identify the workplace factors that affect it. Empirical data was gathered via an online survey which was distributed to members of three commercial airline pilot unions in Europe and Australasia in November 2021. 346 complete responses were received. Using Herzberg's 16 workplace factors as a theoretical frame for the survey and sub\- sequent analysis, the findings showed that, overall, job satisfaction decreased during the pandemic. The largest effect sizes were observed for Salary, Job Security and Working Conditions while the smallest effect sizes were observed for Impacts on Personal Life, Responsibility and Recognition. The importance of effective communi\- cation between airline management and pilots was highlighted. The findings and recommendations regarding employee compensation, benefits and support packages are of relevance not only to airlines but also to other transport and economic sectors facing future disruptive events.},

  abstract = {Many data analysis problems involve the application of a split-apply-combine strategy, where you break up a big problem into manageable pieces, operate on each piece independently and then put all the pieces back together. This insight gives rise to a new R package that allows you to smoothly apply this strategy, without having to worry about the type of structure in which your data is stored. The paper includes two case studies showing how these insights make it easier to work with batting records for veteran baseball players and a large 3d array of spatio-temporal ozone measurements.},

  abstract = {This literature research investigates the working conditions, fatigue, mental health, and working conditions of pilots of network carriers (NWCs) and low-cost carriers (LCCs). According to the McKinsey 7S model, different management strategies entail different HRM practices and working conditions. This research paper provides a holistic overview of previous research by investigating the working conditions, actual rosters, stress levels, sleep problems, fatigue, ad mental health of LCC and NWC flight crew members. Basically, LCC pilots have lower income, younger age, less flight experience, more demanding rosters, more sleep difficulties, and experience more fatigue. Moreover, it seems that LCC working conditions are more related with anxiety due to insecure and atypical contractual conditions. Consequently, the research paper confirms that different management strategies result in different working conditions (e.g., atypical contracts, higher work-related stress, more job insecurity, different levels of fatigue, sleep problems, and potential impairment of mental health), consistently to the detriment of LCC pilots. Lastly, LCC pilots reported more safety issues and more fatigue-related incidents compared with NWC pilots.},

  abstract = {This research aims to examine the relationship between organizational commitment and intention to quit among male and female pilots working in the airline industry. Given the critical role pilots play in aviation, understanding whether gender has a significant impact on these dynamics is one of the objectives of this study. The study also aims to guide airlines in developing effective interview techniques when hiring pilots who exhibit organizational citizenship behaviours (OCB) and could potentially reduce future intentions to quit. These objectives were pursued through surveys measuring the five dimensions of OCB and intention to quit. These surveys were administered to pilot unions and airlines across Turkey, resulting in 484 responses, of which 3 were invalid. The findings indicate statistically significant relationships between gender, OCB, and intention to quit female pilots were found to have lower intentions to quit and displayed higher levels of citizenship behaviour compared to their male counterparts. Limitations of the study include the predominantly male sample, biases arising from self-reported data, a cross-sectional design, and the research's focus on the Turkish airline culture. Despite these limitations, the findings offer important insights into HR strategies for developing OCB and creating gender-related strategies to reduce pilots' intentions to quit. This study presents new perspectives on the gender dynamics of Turkish airline pilots, a rarely discussed topic in aviation literature. It highlights practical implications for HR practices in retaining pilots and deepens the discussion of OCB in male-dominated sectors and cultural contexts.},

  abstract = {This paper draws on a conservation of resources perspective to understand employee voluntary turnover. We conceptualise voluntary turnover as an outcome of resource loss, and we view job embeddedness as an indication of resource levels. On the basis of this conceptualisation, we propose that workplace ostracism and leader--member exchange (LMX) affect voluntary turnover via job embeddedness. We also propose an interaction effect of workplace ostracism and LMX: Workplace ostracism increases voluntary turnover by depleting job embeddedness only when people experience high-quality LMX. Data from 352 employees in a Chinese software company obtained through a three-wave survey support our model. Our findings illuminate the resource consequences of interpersonal interactions on job embeddedness and voluntary turnover, and we offer practical implications for employee retention.},

Although theoretical and empirical implications are encouraging, the construct of JE is still under development. In this paper, we identify five conceptualization and measurement issues warranting additional discussion and research. These are: (1) the composite measure vs. the global measure, (2) conceptual and measurement problems of community embeddedness, (3) conceptual and measurement problems associated with links, (4) discriminant validity issues and (5) the cultural boundaries of JE. For each issue, we discuss our concerns and suggest future research directions.},
